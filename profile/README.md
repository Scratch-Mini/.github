## Important note:
This is not alliliated with the Scratch Team. The original Scratch is available on [their website](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

This project is meant to be a compact version of Scratch meant for phones and small devices. The original Scratch app on the Google Play Store (or Apple App Store) is a mess on phones.
## Removed features:
Extensions are removed. Extensions may be quite a mess on phones and small devices, so in this version it is disabled.
## Changed features:
### UI:
The UI is different with more scrollable area than normal Scratch. The UI is more compact and easy to use without overloading everything.
### Block styles:
Instad of verticals, there are horizontal blocks! They are way better to use of phones and don't take up much space.
